The cordless versions lose their charge very quickly, and after a few months wont hold a charge at all. I went with the Dirt Devil because of another reviewer's suggestion that it is better than the Bissel, and they were right. Works fine for lifting spots and stains. It still requires a lot of elbow grease to scrub out spots, and cleaning the unit is more work than cleaning the carpet. br /> br />I'd be interested to see what the next generation looks like. I am not writing this to say how well it removes red wine from a white carpet because, quite frankly, I don't know if it does or not. Before I got this I was spraying stains with carpet cleaner, then sopping up the mess with paper towels then would finish by taking out the vacuum and sweeping the rest up. I was very pleased with the scrubbing power of the rotating brush-squirter action, but the suction is lacking on this thing. It left the carpet a bit to damp for my personal tastes. It did get out a particularly nasty stain, so I am satisfied. This is an OK product, It's a bit combersome.

I read the reviews for this product and went to Target to pick one up. This is a great product as a spot scrubber. The other people who reviewed this and said the vacuum suction is too small are not understanding that this is a vacuum for small WET messes. It isn't built for that. Don't expect it to do what it isn't built to do. As a disabled person living alone and with a dog with a mind of her own, her \"accidents\" were a breeze to clean up.

If there is a spill (food or drinks) it easily cleans up the stain. I sometimes get lazy and a few days go by before I actually use it to clean up the stain. It cleans the worst grime quickly from the carpet and then vacuums up the dirty water to allow for fast drying. You do have to remove two screws if you want to clean the dirty intake tool, but it isn't necessary to do that every time. It's meant to be a spot cleaner, and I think it does a great job. I use a capful of the Bissell cleaner from my large steamer, and I haven't had a problem. Just remember that this is a spot cleaner, and don't try to clean large areas with it. The machine holds enough water to get out a few carpet stains or spills at a time. My one complaint is that I dropped it on my big toe and that was pretty painful. It may be painful to walk, but my carpet looks much better! It sounds like some folks need to read the instruction manual--you know, the paper inside the box that explains how to use the machine... It works well, I've had to clean up some HUGE spots and it does the job. I purchased it over the Bissell because of reviews that I saw on this site and couldn't be happier. I feel that this was money well spent. I work for a company that specializes in carpet cleaning, so I know what I'm getting into when I buy this product. I have found it to be convenient and well designed. I was pleasantly surprised because from reading other reviews I thought it sounded like a jet engine taking off. I thought it would be a pain to fill and clean. I think the tanks are well designed. When I purchased this item I never thought it would get much use, but having two dogs...a puppy and a very senior citizen...I have used this appliance at least five times already and I am extremely pleased with its performance.

I have used it to suck up spills right after they happen before I pull out my NEW full size. It sucks great, but you have to push and pull it, the cleaner trigger--you have to continuely spray it and it comes out slow. I have 3 small children, so I constantly have spills and spots on the carpet. It doesn't get out the spots. It leaves the carpet REALLY WET. It is more of a hassle to use than it is a convenience. It's bulky and to try to get a spot out is impossible. The thing has no suction power at all and forget about the useless spray that comes with the machine. br /> br />I was going to donate this to the local used merchandise store but I don't want anyone else to waste their time and money on it. For all of the noise this machine made it had almost no suction and I had to soak up the stains and water with a super absorbant sponge.

This contraption lasted less than an hour in my house before being returned.br />1) Cheap brittle plastic housing and tanksbr />2) Ear-deafeningly loud little whiney motorbr />3) Inadequate manual sprayer that dispenses very little but gives your hand world-class exercise. The rotating scrubber brush serves only to spread out the stain, and it had absolutely no suction power so your carpet stays dirty and wet.

I've used rented carpet/upholstery cleaners many times, and I have a reasonable expectation on how they should perform. In regards to cleaning up pet messes---don't even bother, unless you want to have dirty pet messes flying out at you from the side of the tank.

I found the only way to get any use out of this think is to spray another brand spot cleaner (OxiClean or Spot Shot works WAY better than the detergent that comes with this cleaner), and then use the machine to scrub and vacuum the liquid out. We have cats, so I thought this would be good for getting puke spots out of the carpet. The first time I used it, I found that it actually ground the cat puke deeper into the carpet, making the stain impossible to get out.

What a nightmare. A hand-held carpet spot scrubber with vacuum extraction is certainly a terrific idea, but I found that this particular model falls short on performance. The rotating brush is very soft and positioned so that it barely skims the top surface of the carpet fibers: there is certainly no \"deep cleaning\" action.

That means most of the scrubber never touches the carpet during operation. The most important factor for a wet carpet cleaner is the suction power. But without suction power, the carpet cleaner is useless, regardless of what fancy little features gets added. Used this on spilled tea (which darkens if not cleaned right away).\n\n\n\nJOINED SENTENCE :the bristles on the brush aren't very firm and they seem to push whatever you are really trying to clean, further into your carpet, leaving you to wonder if that spot is really clean or just brushed down further into the carpet. when packing up a donations box before moving, this is one thing that went in it. The BIG problem was it sprayed the dirty reservoir tank contents out through the side motor vents and onto my bare legs or pants. I called the Dirtdevil people and they told me that if you tilted it too much it causes the contents to spray out. My immediate thought was that it did not hold a lot of liquid, but then again... it IS only for spots.br />br />Time to get down to the dirty work...br />br />Turned the power switch on and \"VVVRRRRROOOOMMMM!\". The water resivoir is small and the button to spray the water is vaccum released. So after you press the button to squirt the water you have to wait for the stopper to gradually rise again so you can squirt again. SLOW.BR>The scrubbing part works great and did well at working the carpet fibers to get out the stain. I always clean the dirty water tank after using (even if it is only one small spot) because it will stink up the apartment if I don't. I have finally given up and gone to a large carpet cleaner, scrub brush and a bottle of Fantasik to clean up the spots l Every now and then she spits up a large amount of yellow slime that really stains the carpet. I have a large carpet cleaner that will remove the stain, but it's a pain to pull it out every time I have a spot to clean. A sprayer which consists of a reservoir to put the cleaning solution and a trigger that you manually push over and over to spray the solution. It works exactly the same as a spray bottle, except unlike a spray bottle it's heavier and more cumbersome to use due to the fact that it's attached to a scrubber/vacuum.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY IS:[\"And what dirty water does get picked up immediately sprays out of the side vents, spraying me and the carpet I'm trying to clean with nasty wa Broke the plastic catch to the blue solution container and this product is now useless...It never worked well to begin with.\", 'If you plan on using a carpet cleaner a lot, like we do, go with a larger machine.
